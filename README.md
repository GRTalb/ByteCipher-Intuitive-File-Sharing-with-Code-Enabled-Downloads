# File Upload and Download System

This is a simple PHP-based file upload and download system with a basic user interface. It allows users to upload files, generates a unique code for each uploaded file, and provides the ability to download files using the generated code.

## Usage

### Uploading a File

1. Open `index.php` in a web browser.
2. Use the file input to select a file for upload.
3. Click the "Upload" button.
4. A unique code will be generated for the uploaded file.

## Important Notes

- Ensure that the `uploads` folder has the necessary write permissions for file uploads.
- This is a basic example and may not include all security measures for a production environment.
- Additional security considerations, such as input validation and user authentication, should be implemented for a real-world application.

## Real-Time Upload Progress

A real-time upload progress bar has been added using JavaScript and jQuery. It provides visual feedback on the progress of file uploads.

### Dependencies

- jQuery (included via CDN)
